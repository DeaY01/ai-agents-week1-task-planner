**Goal:** Create 5 viral LinkedIn posts this week about 
“How AI agents will change small businesses in Nigeria in 2026” (include hooks + call-to-action).

**TaskPlanner Output:**

1. **Pull 10 trending Nigerian business tweets/posts from last 7 days** → X search + LinkedIn search  
2. **Identify the top 3 hooks that got the most engagement** → Manual scan or simple sort  
3. **Write 5 original hooks that beat the best ones** → GPT-4o / Claude  
4. **Turn each hook into a 100–130 word post (story → lesson → CTA)** → Just write  
5. **Create one clean image per post (Nigerian entrepreneur + AI theme)** → Flux / Midjourney / Canva  
6. **End every post with “Drop a 🔥 if you want the free Week 1 agent”** → Just add  
7. **Schedule posts Mon–Fri at 8:30 am Lagos time** → LinkedIn scheduler or Buffer  

→ Steps 1–3 & 5 can run in parallel  
Ready for autonomous execution? Yes (I only approve before posting)

Perfect for Nigerian audience — works exactly the same in ChatGPT, Grok, or Claude.
